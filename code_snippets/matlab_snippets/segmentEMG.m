function [ESig  ELabel] = segmentEMG(Sig,WTime,STime,MTime,SFreq,MLabel)
% To segment signal by a certain rule to a cell, which is 1*n that n is for
% the number of motions. Every unit is a A * B *C matrix that A stands for 
% the number of data in an analysis window, B stands for the number of
% the channel, C stands for the number of samples in one motion.
% Caution: this function did not compute the transition time between
% motions. So it fits to compute the training data.
% Input variables:
%                Sig is original signal.                              data by channel matrix 
%                WTime is the time of an analysis window.             seconds
%                STime is the time of a sliding window.               seconds
%                MTime is the lasting time of a single motion.        seconds
%                SFreq is the Sample Frequency.
%                MLabel is the label of the motions.   vector
